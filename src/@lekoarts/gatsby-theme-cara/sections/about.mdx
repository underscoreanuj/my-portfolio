## About 

#### A technophile with a love for challenges. 

I'm always looking for problems which force me to think out of the box or come up with something new. 
I can easily stand out in a challenging situation with my strong analytical skills and ability to derive logic from given inferences. 
So far, I've worked extensively on a wide set of projects in multiple domains which give me the knowledge and flexibility that is expected from a great developer. 

I've worked for different companies on some challenging projects and have managed to rise higher than the expectations of my team in a very short span of time. 

Apart from being a full-time superhero, I also love reading books, playing games and learning new skills.
